# 👋 Hello everybody!

I'm **Sathiya** — a full-stack developer and data engineer with a passion for building things that just *work*. 

Whether it’s creating seamless web apps, designing smart data pipelines, or automating tasks end-to-end, I love bringing ideas to life with code. I’m also keen on exploring the frontiers of AI, blockchain, and cloud tech.

## 🚀 What I’m Up To

- Building & designing full-stack applications
- Designing and automating robust data pipelines
- Automating workflows to save time (and sanity)
- Writing smart contracts with **Solidity**
- Experimenting with **AI**, **Machine Learning**, **Blockchain**, and all things **Cloud**

## 📚 What I’ve Learned

- Deep dive into **data engineering** & **databases**
- **Solidity** and blockchain fundamentals
- Mastery of cloud-native workflows and tools
- Building apps from backend to frontend

## 🌱 Currently Leveling Up On

- **LLMs** & tailored workflows
- **Autonomous AI Agents**
- **Multi-Modal LLMs & Co-Pilots** (text, vision, audio, action)
- **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for smarter, real-time apps
- **Vector Databases** & embedding pipelines
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for persistent memory & context
- Model fine-tuning with **LoRA**, **QLoRA**, & custom LLMs
- Integrating **LLMs with robotics** (Physical AI!)
